# SEPA - SPARQL Event Processing Architecture

SEPA is a publish-subscribe architecture designed to support information level interoperability. The architecture is built on top of a generic SPARQL endpoint where publishers and subscribers use standard **SPARQL** Updates and Queries. Notifications about events (i.e., changes in the **RDF** knowledge base) are expressed in terms of added and removed SPARQL binding results since the previous notification.

## Installation

1) Download the [SEPA Engine](https://github.com/arces-wot/SEPA/releases/download/0.7.0/engine-0.7.0.rar)
2) Unzip the archive
3) Open a teminal and move to the unzipped folder
4) Run `java -Dcom.sun.management.config.file=jmx.properties -jar engine-x.y.z.jar`
5) Open a new terminal and run `jconsole` and connect to localhost:5555 with `root:root` credentials. This allows to montior and control the engine using JMX
6) Download [Blazegraph](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bigdata/files/latest/download) (or use any other SPARQL 1.1 Protocol compliant service) and run it as shown [here](https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_Start)

## History

SEPA has been inspired and influenced by [Smart-M3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smart-m3/). SEPA authors have been involved in the development of Smart-M3 since its [origin](https://artemis-ia.eu/project/4-sofia.html). 

The main differences beetween SEPA and Smart-M3 are the protocol (now compliant with the [SPARQL 1.1 Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/)) and the introduction of a security layer (based on TLS and JSON Web Token for client authentication). 

All the SEPA software components have been implemented from scratch.
