# SEPA - SPARQL Event Processing Architecture

SEPA is a publish-subscribe architecture designed to support information level interoperability. The architecture is built on top of a generic SPARQL endpoint where publishers and subscribers use standard **SPARQL** Updates and Queries. Notifications about events (i.e., changes in the **RDF** knowledge base) are expressed in terms of added and removed SPARQL binding results since the previous notification.
